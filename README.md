## Open Source, Fully customizable Web Developer Portfolio Template
Built with HTML, Flexbox (and soon to be a bit of JS)


Inspired by this [template](https://github.com/RyanFitzgerald/devportfolio-template), I wanted to build a similiar template, but without any of the unnecesary jQuery, Javascript, Boostrap, or SASS. I wanted something very, very simple that anyone can edit as they please.
